But how did this come about in the first place ?
Well, we too started out programming in C, C++, &amp;amp; Java with a bit of scripting languages here and there. But our secret passion lay in LISP &amp;amp; its dialects like Scheme, to which we got introduced by the legendary Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
Our own experience with imperative followed by object-oriented programming, and the recent work with huge amounts of JavaScript frameworks got us convinced that Functional Programming was the way to go.</description>
